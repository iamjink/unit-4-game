CrystalsCollector Game 

This is a number guessing game that you can play with some math!

How to play:

The user will be given a random number at the start of the game displayed in the left hand side box. 

The user are given four crystals and each crystal has a random value assigned to it.

User can click on which ever crystal as many times as he/she wants to match the given number. 

If the number that adds from the crystal clicks goes over the given number, then user loses! 

If that number matches the given number, then user wins!


This exercise will help practice jQuery and JavaScript with the button click functions and functions that display different numbers generated from other functions.
